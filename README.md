<p>
Aid Learning FrameWork is a Linux system with GUI running on Android phone for AI programming without root. It means that when it is installed, your Android phone owned a Linux system with GUI which can run AI program in it. Now we support Caffe, Tensorflow, Mxnet, ncnn, Keras, cv2, Git/SSH powerfully. 

Furthermore we provide an AI coding develop tool named Aid_code. It can provide you a visual AI programming experience by using Python from zero on our framework!

Now you have a complete linux with a GUI running on Android (Real linux running on the busybox and not virtul environment. So it is faster and almost real-time.) and can write your AI code on it visually!

# Powerful
Caffe, Tensorflow, Mxnet, ncnn, Keras...Almost include all the AI framework , you don't need to config the AI framework complexly. All build in one !

# Graphical User Interface
We fixed Graphical User Interface for the Linux on Andorid(It has been pruned by andorid!), so you can use the GUI just like on the pc. For instance, You can use opencv to open and view camera!

# Real-Time
Real linux running on the busybox and not virtul environment like VirtulBox. So it is faster and almost real-time

# Easy to use
We provide a plenty of examples and by using our framework, you can run it with a tap, and then get a visual log to show the informations or errors.

# Energy Star

According to the test on the mainstream smartphone like Samsung, Aid Learning Framework only use 1% power consumption in a whole day (Standby)

# Examples Inside:
<p>Facencnn(mobiefacenet ncnn) 15fps in mobile phone
<p>Face Landmark (106 keypoints ncnn) 15fps  in mobile phone
<p>handpose (tensorflow ) 5fps  in mobile phone
<p>body posenet for single person(converted from google ) 10fps  in mobile phone
<p>body posenet for multi-person(converted from google ) 7fps  in mobile phone
<p>Stylized picture(GAN ) 3fps in mobile phone

# Need to occupy mobile phone Size
The entry app program（apk） is only 7M，when you install the apk ,the apk will download the depdence of the framework
is 350M and 350M examples of AI codes using python. all is about 700M size.

# How to work?
You just need download the aidlux.apk[ aidlux.apk](aidlux0510.apk),and install it,it only 7M size.

# SSH (use the pc to connect to Aidlearning and control it using the pc's terminal)
Just open the url:mobilephone'sip:8910/upload in the pc to upload ssh's file. for example:http://192.168.1.6:8910/upload


# Editing code by pc 
  you can open the url:mobilephone'sip:8900/ in the pc to Editing codes files(python files storing in the AidLearnig ) in the pc when the mobile phone and the pc in the same network group.
